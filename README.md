# Arras.io Private Server Template

## Quick Start Guide

1. Click the top right where it says **Remix to Edit :microphone:**
2. Give your new project a name. Note that you can start the name with a gamemode code (seen below) to specify its gamemode.
3. Your private server name will be at arrax-io.glitch.me/#private=arrax-template.glitch.me (replace `arras-template` with it's new name)

## More Information

1. Open the file at the left named `ðŸ”‘ .env`
2. Fill it in with
```
SECRET=aSecretPasswordHere
```
3. Open the private server with arrax-io.glitch.me/#private=arrax-template.glitch.me;aSecretPasswordHere (replace `aSecretPasswordHere` with the password)
4. The map/config data are in the `config.js` file
5. The tank data are in the `lib/definitions.js` file
6. Other stuff (score curve, stat amount) are in the `server.js` file

## Gamemode Code

You can start the name with a gamemode code to specify its gamemode, such as `f-arrax-template` where `f` is the gamemode code.

Parts of the gamemode code must appear in the order below, all of which are optional:
- `p` for Private
- `e` for customized event names, which is followed by the length of the event name and then the event name itself, such as `e5space`
- `o` for Open
- `m` for Maze
- `f` for FFA, `2` for 2 Teams, `3` for 3 Teams, or `4` for 4 Teams
- `d` for Domination or `m` for Mothership

Note:
- Maze FFA and 2 Teams Mothership are replaced with just Maze and Mothership
- Team modes without domination or mothership are changed to TDM instead of Teams
- Although Maze is before the team number in the gamemode code, they are moved to be after it in the displayed name (`m2` to 2TDM Maze)
 
## Breaking Changes

Breaking changes are important updates to the template that you should do on your server, as otherwise it may stop functioning. The last breaking change is on April 10th, 2019. If you've made a private server before that day, it may no longer work without this update. See `CHANGELOG.md` for details.
